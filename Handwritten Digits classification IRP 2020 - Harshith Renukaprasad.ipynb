    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: Most of the materials included are digital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Disclaimer: This project was done on Visual Studio Code, but is submitted/presented in Jupyter notebook for the users ease in readablity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first and foremost thing required for this project is a computer with  [Visual Studio Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (200  megabytes, Windows 64 bit) installed. Note that the computer needs to  have atleast 1 gigabyte of ram and 5 gigabytes of storage available. The computer, very importantly, also requires a stable internet connection. Finally, [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-amd64.exe) (downloaded, and added to path throught the installer)needs to be installed on the system\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A google account to login to the websites [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g). Hackerrank is a very popular website used to practice python, since this whole project is written using the language Python (version 3.7.6). Youtube is required to actually learn the language and the hyperlink on the word \"Youtube\" earlier links to a channel called Corey Schafer, from which all the learning for python, and its various packages were done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Speaking of packages, the there are only 4 packages required for this project which are Keras, Sklearn, pandas, matplotlib and finally tensorflow. All of these can be installed by opening up Visual Studio Code, opening a new terminal by clicking on terminal on the top taskbar, and typing in \"pip install keras\", wait for it to install, \"pip install sklearn\", waiting for Sklearn to install, and finally \"pip install tensorflow\", and allow tensorflow(make sure version 2.1.0 is installing) to finish installing. Pandas and Matplotlib can be installed using the same \"pip install \" command. Do the same with  Note that the full extent of some packages are not used, rather a parts of it or \"Modules\" are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A lot of time, around 100 to 120 hours of work are required to finish the project. 60 hours are required to learn python, 20 to learn about machine learning and another 20 hours to actually code. This may take longer or shorter depending on the amount of coding/python known. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A website known as [Markdown Tables gererator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) which allows for the data table of this project to be created and embedded into the markdown cells(text cells instead of code cells) with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Also, this project has a link further on to the mnist database of handwritten numbers, but that is just for ease of access, as keras has a module through which mnist can be imported.\n"

This does exactly what the name suggests and loads the variables with training and test data. The variables being x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test. x and y are not coordinates, but rather x is the input and y is the output. The training variables, x_train, and  y_train are where all the training images that the computer uses to learn are kept. While x_test, and y_test are where the testing images are kept. These images are what the computer tests itself on to refine the algorithm. There are 60,000 images in the mnist database and by default, 50,000 are kept for training and the remaining 10,000 are used as testing images. on the 4th and 5th lines of the cell, the function train_test_split() is used to split the data into training and testing images by taking a percentage value which is then applied to the database and made into the test set. For example, if the percentage is given as 0.5 or 50%, 30,000 images would be used as testing and 30,000 for training. This is not a set value however, there is a parameter known as test_size_per which allows the percentage to be changed every time the function is called upon."

All the images are now reshaped into 28 x 28, just in case some of them were not that size. Furthermore, this uniformity allows the computer to look at all of the images consistently the same. Furthermore, all the images are shuffled, so that certain patterns and exclusions of digits do not occur, therefore removing the chance that the computer's \"learning\" is skewed. In summation, this function allows for the uniformity of the images so that the computer sees every image equally and is not skewed by unnatural patterns such as the abscence of a certain digit."

    "This function is what sets up a model(convolutional neural network), and trains it with the training set. This is still a function, and is not executing anything, so no output is given. The way a machine learning model learns/trains itself is that it uses differential calculus. Bascially, an inverse parabola is graphed internally, called the gradient descent that allows the computer to see where it is. The x axis is the answer that it is guessing. For example, an eight is given as an input, and the computer guesses that it's a 5. Now, that is the wrong answer, but atleast the computer now knows that the eight is not a 5. The y axis is the cost. Basically the higher the cost, the farther the model is from the answer. Graphing this would show an inverse parabola, where the answer(the number eight in the example) on the x axis, and the lowest value on the y axis(the cost) are located. The end goal of the model is to reach that low point. once it does, and it gets a problem correct, it moves on and uses the same formula that it used for the previous one. Basically, the computer at first uses random values, and then narrows it down to the correct value, and uses the formula that got it the correct values. This is all calculated in a matter of mere seconds though. This is why a larger training set, like common sense would tell us, makes the computer more accurate in its learning and testing. Below is an image of the gradient descent.  "

    "This is the final step for this project and does not involve much. The three main things that are part of this step are the variables summary_values, training_sets and the for loop. The variable summary_values is a dictionary variable that allows for the ending data for each training size to be collected and stored safely. This variable is printed at the end to allow for easy data collection. The variable training_sets is used in conjunction with the for loop to iterate through each amount of training images. The variable test_per is being iterated with each value in the array training_sets and is converted into a percentage to be put into the function load_mnist_data and specify what percent of the images are training. The results of the project are displayed above and the data table and graphs are made and printed down below"

    "This project was a very interesting project overall. The big takeaways from this project were that the more training data that a machine learning algorithm is provided with, the higher the accuracy is. Machine learning algorithms are also highly sensitive to patterns and at any moment a slight pattern emerges, the algorithm shifts to accomodate that pattern. The hypothesis was also proven right with the results showing a drastic, and highly noticeable difference between the first training set of 100, and the last training set of 50,000, which got to 99% accuracy. All of this serves to quantify the notion that machines need a lot of examples and time to to learn/understand what they are looking at, and apply that to test images. The first training sets had very low accuracy, and this was because it was being tested on something it might not even have seen."

    "This project is just a stepping stone into the world of machine leearning. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have huge applications in the future, allowing for humans to take a backseat in  the world and allow computers to do more and more things for us. Machine learning works extremely similarly to a human brain. Neural networks are just very, very small simulations of actual neurons in the brain. This project used just one kind of neural network, a convolutional neural network. However, there are a lot of differing kinds of neural networks that allow for increasingly complicated and better implementations of artificial intelligence for purposes as varied as facial recognition and YouTube ads."

    "Matrices are a fundamental element in linear algebra. They are used widely in the realm of machine learning especially in the input data variable(x) to train the algorithm. A matrix is at its lowest complexity, an array within an array with columns and rows. Matrices can be used in arithmetic operations as well and have been made greatly easier by python libraries such as pandas, and NumPy.\n",

    "Image recognition is exactly what it sounds like. It is the recognition of images. The human brain makes this really easy, but computers, on the other hand, don’t have the intuition that humans have to recognize and evaluate images. There are 4 steps that are required to teach computers how to recognize images. First, all images are made up of pixels and you need to extract them from the image. Secondly, classify those pixels into labeled data sets. Thirdly, the hardest step, train the machine to be able to recognize images. lastly, Predict a new image that classifies under one of the categories. \n",
